# Java Ideas

This repo contains a few branches.

- Master is the completed code
- Starter Code provides the Idea bean but wants you to create the Controller and View
- create-controller has everything from the starter code, but has the views completed and wants you to follow the comments in the `IdeasController` to complete the class
- create-view has everything from the starter code but has a completed controller and wants you complete the views using `JSTL`
